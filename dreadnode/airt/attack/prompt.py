    Creates a generalized generative attack using an attacker to refine prompts
    and an evaluator to score the target's responses against a goal.

        goal: The high-level objective of the attack.
        target: The target system to be attacked.
        attacker_model: The language model used to generate and refine prompts.
        evaluator_model: The language model used to score the effectiveness of responses.
        refine_guidance: Specific guidance for the attacker model on how to refine prompts.
                         If None, a default guidance based on the goal is used.
        evaluation_rubric: The rubric for the evaluator model to score responses.
                           If None, a default rubric based on the goal is used.
        initial_prompt: The starting prompt for the search. If None, the goal is used.
        beam_width: The number of candidate prompts to maintain at each step of the search.
        branching_factor: The number of new candidates to generate from each existing candidate.
        max_steps: The maximum number of steps for the attack.
        additional_scorers: A list of additional scorers to be combined with the primary
                            LLM-based scorer.
