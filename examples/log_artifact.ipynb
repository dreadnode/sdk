    "# Logging Artifacts\n",

    "Reproducibility: Ensure your runs can reference the exact files used\n",
    "Organization: Maintain the structure of complex file hierarchies\n",

    "Traceability: Connect inputs, outputs, and code in one place\n",
    "\n",
    "### Setup\n",
    "First, we need to import the necessary functions and configure our Dreadnode environment, providing your API Key"
