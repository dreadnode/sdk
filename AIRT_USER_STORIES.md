## üéØ **User Story 1: The Enterprise Security Assessment**

### **The Problem**
Sarah is a Senior Security Engineer at a Fortune 500 financial services company. Her company has deployed multiple AI models for fraud detection, customer support chatbots, and document classification. The CISO mandates quarterly AI security assessments, but current approaches are manual, inconsistent, and take weeks to complete across their 12 production AI systems.

**Current Pain Points:**
- Manual testing takes 3-4 weeks per model
- Inconsistent methodology across different testers  
- No standardized reporting or metrics
- Can't prove compliance to auditors
- High cost ($50K+ per assessment using external consultants)

### **The Dreadnode Solution**

Sarah discovers Dreadnode's AIRT module and implements automated AI red teaming across her organization's AI portfolio.

```python
import dreadnode as dn

# Configure for enterprise deployment
dn.configure(
    server="https://enterprise.dreadnode.io",
    token=os.getenv("DREADNODE_ENTERPRISE_TOKEN"),
    project="q4-2024-ai-security-assessment"
)

# Define all production AI targets
production_targets = [
    dn.airt.HTTPTarget("https://internal-api.company.com/fraud-detection", api_key=FRAUD_API_KEY),
    dn.airt.HTTPTarget("https://internal-api.company.com/chatbot", api_key=CHAT_API_KEY),
    dn.airt.HTTPTarget("https://internal-api.company.com/document-classifier", api_key=DOC_API_KEY),
    # ... 9 more targets
]

# Create comprehensive security assessment campaign
assessment_campaign = dn.airt.SecurityCampaign(
    name="Q4-2024-Enterprise-AI-Security-Assessment",
    targets=production_targets,
    compliance_frameworks=["SOX", "PCI-DSS", "NIST-AI-RMF"],
)

# Execute full assessment with all three attack types
with dn.run("enterprise-ai-security-assessment"):
    # Automated evasion testing
    evasion_results = await assessment_campaign.run_evasion_assessment(
        test_cases_per_model=100,
        attack_types=["targeted", "untargeted"],
        data_types=["text", "structured"],
    )
    
    # Model extraction testing
    extraction_results = await assessment_campaign.run_extraction_assessment(
        query_budget_per_model=5000,
        fidelity_threshold=0.8,
    )
    
    # Privacy/data inversion testing
    privacy_results = await assessment_campaign.run_privacy_assessment(
        categories=["PII", "financial", "health"],
        confidence_threshold=0.75,
    )
    
    # Generate executive report
    report = assessment_campaign.generate_compliance_report(
        include_executive_summary=True,
        include_technical_details=True,
        export_formats=["pdf", "json", "csv"]
    )
```

### **The Business Impact**

**Time Savings**: Assessment time drops from 12-16 weeks to 2-3 days
**Cost Reduction**: From $600K annually (12 models √ó $50K) to $60K Dreadnode subscription  
**Compliance Confidence**: Automated, auditable reports with standardized metrics
**Risk Mitigation**: Discovered 23 vulnerabilities across their AI systems before attackers could exploit them
**Executive Buy-in**: Clear ROI demonstration leads to expanded security budget

**ROI Calculation:**
- Previous cost: $600K/year in consultant fees
- Dreadnode cost: $60K/year enterprise subscription
- **Cost savings: $540K annually (900% ROI)**
- Additional value: Continuous monitoring, standardized processes, audit trail

## üõ°Ô∏è **User Story 2: The AI Startup's Investor Due Diligence**

### **The Problem** 
Alex is CTO of an AI startup that has developed a revolutionary medical diagnosis AI. They're raising a Series B round, but potential investors are increasingly asking tough questions about AI security and safety. One lead investor specifically requires independent AI red teaming before they'll commit their $10M investment.

**Current Challenges:**
- External AI security firms quote $150K+ for assessment
- Timeline pressure: Investor wants results in 2 weeks
- Limited budget pre-funding
- Need to prove AI safety without revealing proprietary model details
- Founders worry about false positives damaging investor confidence

### **The Dreadnode Solution**

Alex uses Dreadnode's AIRT module to conduct comprehensive self-assessment that satisfies investor requirements while maintaining control over the process.

```python
import dreadnode as dn
from dreadnode import airt, scoring

dn.configure(
    server="https://api.dreadnode.io", 
    token=os.getenv("DREADNODE_TOKEN"),
    project="series-b-ai-security-assessment"
)

# Set up medical AI target (black-box only)
medical_ai = airt.HTTPTarget(
    endpoint="https://api.medai-startup.com/diagnose",
    api_key=os.getenv("MEDICAL_AI_API_KEY"),
    rate_limit_delay=0.5,  # Respect production limits
)

# Create investor-grade assessment with professional grading
assessment_config = airt.InvestorAssessmentConfig(
    compliance_standards=["FDA", "HIPAA", "GDPR"],
    attack_sophistication="advanced",
    generate_investor_report=True,
)

with dn.run("series-b-security-assessment"):
    # Medical AI safety testing
    safety_results = await airt.medical_safety_assessment(
        target=medical_ai,
        medical_categories=["diagnosis", "treatment", "dosage"],
        harm_detection=scoring.MedicalHarmGrader(),
        sample_size=500,
    )
    
    # Privacy compliance testing  
    privacy_results = await airt.privacy_compliance_test(
        target=medical_ai,
        regulations=["HIPAA", "GDPR"],
        pii_categories=["health", "biometric", "genetic"],
        grader=scoring.ComplianceGrader(standards=["HIPAA"]),
    )
    
    # Model robustness testing
    robustness_results = await airt.robustness_assessment(
        target=medical_ai,
        perturbation_types=["medical_terminology", "symptom_variants"],
        confidence_analysis=True,
        grader=scoring.RobustnessGrader(),
    )
    
    # Generate investor-ready report
    investor_report = airt.generate_investor_security_report(
        assessment_results=[safety_results, privacy_results, robustness_results],
        executive_summary=True,
        third_party_validation=True,  # Dreadnode provides validation
        export_format="pdf"
    )
    
    print(f"Assessment complete. Overall security score: {investor_report.overall_score}/100")
    print(f"Report ready for investor review: {investor_report.report_path}")
```

### **The Business Impact**

**Speed to Market**: 2-day assessment vs 2-week external audit
**Cost Efficiency**: $5K Dreadnode subscription vs $150K external assessment
