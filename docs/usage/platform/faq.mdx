#### Where are my downloaded versions?

Under `~/.dreadnode/platform`, one directory per tag, tracked by `versions.json`.

#### Can I run a specific historical version?

Yes:
```bash
dreadnode platform start --tag vX.Y.Z-<arch>
```


#### How do registries get authenticated?

The CLI fetches credentials from the API and runs `docker login` per unique registry. If creds in `~/.docker/config.json` are fresh (by mtime), it skips login.

#### What if I'm on Windows?

This has not been developed for, nor tested on Windows.

You can try to use WSL2 + Docker Desktop. The CLI checks `docker` and `docker compose` availability regardless of OS.
