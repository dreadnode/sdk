## Local cache & manifest

- Base directory: `~/.dreadnode/platform`
- Manifest: `versions.json`
  - Tracks all downloaded versions and which one is **current**
- Per-version directory: `~/.dreadnode/platform/<tag>`
  - `docker-compose.yaml`
  - `.dreadnode-api.env`, `.api.example.env`
  - `.dreadnode-ui.env`, `.ui.example.env`
  - `.env` (generated on start, concatenation of `.dreadnode-api.env` + `.dreadnode-ui.env`)

## Services

Two primary services:

- `api` — the Dreadnode backend API
- `ui` — the Dreadnode frontend

## Composite `.env`

On `start`, the CLI concatenates:

1. `.<API>.env`
2. `.<UI>.env`

into a **generated** `.env` consumed by Docker Compose.

<Warning>
Don't edit the generated `.env` directly—your changes will be overwritten on next start. Edit `.dreadnode-api.env` and `.dreadnode-ui.env` instead.
</Warning>

## Upgrade-time env merge

If you opt-in during `upgrade`:

- **Local changes win** over remote defaults.
- **Removed keys** upstream are dropped only when your local value wasn't changed from the original.
- **New remote keys** are added.
- **New local keys** are preserved.
- The merge attempts to keep **section context and formatting** where possible.
