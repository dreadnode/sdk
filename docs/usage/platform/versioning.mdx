## Architectures

Supported architectures:

- `amd64`
- `arm64`

On machines reporting `x86_64`/`AMD64` → `amd64`  
On machines reporting `arm64`/`aarch64`/`ARM64` → `arm64`

## Latest tags

The CLI constructs **arch-aware** latest tags:

```txt
latest-amd64
latest-arm64
```

When you run `start` without a current version, it resolves to the appropriate `latest-<arch>`.
