Once installed, use the `platform` namespace:

```bash
dreadnode platform --help
````

### Start the platform

```bash
# Start current version, or download the latest for your architecture if none exists
dreadnode platform start

# Start a specific tag
dreadnode platform start --tag v1.2.3-amd64
```

What happens:

1. Logs in to the remote container registries.
1. Downloads any necessary definition and configuration files.
1. Pulls the latest images.
1. Runs the containers.

### Stop the platform

```bash
dreadnode platform stop
# alias:
dreadnode platform down
```

Stops and removes all running application containers.

**Note:** This will NOT remove any data or delete images. You can restart the containers again.

### Download a specific version (without starting)

```bash
dreadnode platform download --tag v1.2.3-amd64
dreadnode platform download --tag latest-amd64
```

This fetches templates and writes them under the [versioned environment](/platform/cli/environment)

### Upgrade to the latest

```bash
dreadnode platform upgrade
```

Flow:

1. Resolves `latest-<arch>` and downloads it.
2. If the remote is **newer** than your current semver, prompts to continue.
3. Optionally **merges env files** from your current version into the new version
   (local changes win; removed keys are dropped if unchanged; new remote keys are added).
4. Stops the current version and starts the upgraded one.

<Note>
If you skip the merge, your new version will carry the stock `.<service>.env` files from its templates.
</Note>

### Refresh registry auth (out-of-band)

```bash
dreadnode platform refresh-registry-auth
```

If you are modifying or restarting the platform out of band (using Docker Compose), you may need to refresh credentials to the private image registries.

### Connect the SDK
Once you've started the platform, you can connect the SDK by running:

```bash
dreadnode login --server http://localhost --profile local
```

<Info>
Make sure to replace `http://localhost` with the appropriate URL if you are accessing the platform remotely.
</Info>

You can now start shipping data to your local Dreadnode instance!

or, if you are using the Python SDK, see [the Python SDK docs](/strikes/usage/config#self-hosted-platforms).
