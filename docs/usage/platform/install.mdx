````

#### Prerequisites

* **Docker** and **Docker Compose** must be installed and available on `PATH`.

* **Dreadnode Account** (for registry credentials and templates).

  * The CLI will use your configured API client (`create_api_client()`) to fetch releases and credentials.
  * You can create your account [here](https://platform.dreadnode.io).

<Warning>
To access the private Dreadnode Platform images, you need a Dreadnode account and a Platform license.
