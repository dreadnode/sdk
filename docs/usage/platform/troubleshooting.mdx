#### Docker / Compose not found

- Ensure Docker Desktop or Docker Engine + Compose V2 is installed.
- Verify:

  ```bash
  docker --version
  docker compose --version
  ```

#### 403 Forbidden Error

- Ensure you've completed `dreadnode login` to the Dreadnode server.
- Ensure you've gotten a Platform License from [Dreadnode](https://dreadnode.com/contact-us).

#### Failing to log into container registry

* Ensure your API client is configured and can retrieve registry credentials.
* Re-run:

  ```bash
  dreadnode platform refresh_registry_auth
  ```
* If credentials look stale, delete `~/.docker/config.json` entries for the registry and try again.

#### UI URL not printed

* The CLI tries to read `ORIGIN` from the `dreadnode-ui` container:

  ```bash
  docker inspect -f '{{range .Config.Env}}{{println .}}{{end}}' dreadnode-ui | grep ORIGIN
  ```
* If it's not set, check container logs and env configuration in `.dreadnode-ui.env`.

#### Start succeeds but services are unhealthy

* Inspect containers:

  ```bash
  docker compose -f ~/.dreadnode/platform/<tag>/docker-compose.yaml ps
  docker compose -f ~/.dreadnode/platform/<tag>/docker-compose.yaml logs -f
  ```
* Verify required env vars are populated in `.dreadnode-api.env` and `.dreadnode-ui.env`.

#### Upgrade didn't apply my custom env changes

* If you **skipped** the merge step, your new version uses stock envs.
* Re-run `upgrade` again (or manually port your changes), then `start`.

<Note>
You can always edit `.<service>.env` and restart to apply configuration changes.
