title: 'Configure'
description: 'Set persistent platform configuration via key-value overrides; list, unset, or apply one-off overrides at start'
public: true
---

Use the `configure` command to **persist platform overrides** (e.g., ports, proxy host) for the **current** platform version, or for a **specific image tag**.  
You can also supply **one-off (ephemeral) overrides** directly to `start` for a single run—see **Start-time overrides** below.

<Info>
Overrides are stored with the selected platform version and take effect the **next time you start or restart** the platform. You can modify or remove them at any time.
</Info>

## TL;DR

```bash
# Persist one or more overrides on the current version
dreadnode platform configure KEY VALUE [KEY2 VALUE2 ...]

# Target a specific version by image tag when persisting
dreadnode platform configure KEY VALUE --tag v1.3.4

# List currently active persistent overrides
dreadnode platform configure --list

# Unset (remove) one or more persistent overrides
dreadnode platform configure --unset KEY [KEY2 KEY3 ...]
````

### Examples

```bash
# Configure an HTTP proxy host and expose the API on a custom port
dreadnode platform configure proxy-host myproxy.local api-port 8080

# Target a specific image tag (when you have multiple downloaded)
dreadnode platform configure proxy-host corp-proxy --tag v1.3.4

# Remove a single override
dreadnode platform configure --unset proxy-host

# Remove multiple overrides at once
dreadnode platform configure --unset proxy-host api-port
```

## Behavior & File Outputs

When you run `configure`:

1. The command resolves the **selected platform version**:

   * If `--tag` is provided, it uses that local version.
   * Otherwise, it uses your **current** platform version.
2. It **writes your overrides** to that version's configuration-overrides file.
3. It also ensures a Docker Compose override is prepared so changes apply cleanly on the next start.

On start, the platform **regenerates** its runtime configuration (Compose files and a composite `.env`) and **applies your persistent overrides on top** of the base service configuration.

<Info>
If **no current platform version** is set (and no `--tag` is provided), you'll be prompted to start or download a platform version first.
</Info>

## Flags (configure)

* `--list, -l`
  Prints the currently configured persistent overrides for the selected version. Cannot be combined with positional `KEY VALUE` arguments.

* `--unset, -u`
  Removes the specified keys. Provide one or more keys (**values are not required** when using `--unset`).

* `--tag <image-tag>`
  Apply changes to a **specific** downloaded image tag instead of the current version.

## Input Rules (configure)

* Without `--unset`, arguments must be provided as **key-value pairs**:

  ```bash
  dreadnode platform configure KEY VALUE [KEY2 VALUE2 ...]
  ```
* With `--unset`, provide **one or more keys** (no values):

  ```bash
  dreadnode platform configure --unset KEY [KEY2 ...]
  ```

# Start-time overrides (one-off)

You can pass **temporary overrides** directly to `start`. These apply **only to that run** and are cleared the next time you start **without** those flags.

```bash
# Start the current (or resolved) version
dreadnode platform start

# Start a specific image tag
dreadnode platform start --tag v1.3.4

# Start with one-off overrides (use --key value form)
dreadnode platform start --proxy-host myproxy.local --api-port 8080
```

### How it works

* `start` accepts arbitrary **`--key value`** pairs as environment overrides (e.g., `--proxy-host myproxy.local`).
* If any are provided, they are written to a **start-argument overrides file** for this run.
* If none are provided, the **start-argument overrides file is removed** before launching, returning you to your **persistent** configuration.

### Precedence (highest first)

1. **Start-time (one-off) overrides** passed via `dreadnode platform start --key value`
2. **Persistent overrides** set via `dreadnode platform configure`
3. **Base configuration** and service defaults

This means a key like `proxy-host` passed to `start` will **override** the same key from `configure`—but **only for that run**.

### Examples

```bash
# Temporarily change API port for this run only
dreadnode platform start --api-port 9090

# Temporarily bypass proxy for this run, regardless of persistent settings
dreadnode platform start --proxy-host ""

# Combine with a tag you haven't marked current yet
dreadnode platform start --tag v2.0.0 --api-port 8081
```

<Note>
To make a one-off override permanent, set it with `dreadnode platform configure KEY VALUE`, then start without the flag.
</Note>

## Start behavior

* If Docker/Docker Compose requirements aren't met, the command exits with an error.
* With `--tag`, the specified tag is **downloaded (if necessary)** and marked current before running.
* Without `--tag`, if a current version exists it is used; otherwise the **latest** is downloaded and marked current.
* On success, you'll see the app URL(s) if available.

---

## Migration Notes (from older docs)

* **Old behavior:** `platform configure` opened per-service env files (e.g., `.dreadnode-api.env`, `.dreadnode-ui.env`) in your editor.
* **New behavior:**

  * `platform configure` **persists** key-value overrides (no editor).
  * `platform start` can accept **ephemeral** key-value overrides via `--key value` flags for a single run.

<Note>
You can still edit service env files directly if needed, but for repeatable, layered config, prefer `configure` for persistence and `start --key value` for safe one-offs.
</Note>
