Deploy Dreadnode's evaluation and observability platform entirely within your own infrastructure to maintain complete control over sensitive security data.

#### Why self-host Dreadnode?

- **Keep your sensitive data secure**

- **Meet your compliance requirements**

- **Control your evaluation environment**

- **Connect to your data, tools, and models**


#### What you get

- **Full-featured evaluation platform** — All the same capabilities as Dreadnode Cloud, running entirely in your environment
- **Simple deployment** — One-command setup that handles version management, container orchestration, and configuration
- **Seamless updates** — Upgrade to latest features while preserving your custom configurations and data
- **Architecture flexibility** — Runs in Docker on Linux or Mac (advanced cloud deployments coming soon)

#### How it works

The self-hosted platform uses a simple CLI to manage your local Dreadnode deployment.
Behind the scenes, it handles version downloads, Docker container management, environment configuration, and secure registry access — so you can focus on your security evaluations instead of infrastructure management.

<Info>
Access all platform management through the `dreadnode platform` CLI commands (start, stop, upgrade, etc.).
