Projects are the highest level of organization for your work in Strikes. For the most part, they exist outside of code and organize related runs. Projects are the primary means for leveraging generated data, whether for performance comparison or data export and analysis.

Runs are always associated with a project, and will be placed in a **Default** project if you don't specify one.

Projects can be created manually using the UI, but it's often easier to let the Platform create one automatically by specifying a new project name in code or with an environment variable.

<CodeGroup>
```python dreadnode.run()
import dreadnode

dreadnode.configure()

# Specify a project for a single run
with dreadnode.run(project="my-project"):
    # ...
    pass
```

```python dreadnode.configure()
import dreadnode

# Specify a default project for all runs
dreadnode.configure(project="my-project")

with dreadnode.run():
    # ...
    pass
```

```python Environment variable
import dreadnode

# $ export DREADNODE_PROJECT=my-project

dreadnode.configure()

with dreadnode.run():
    # ...
    pass
```
