The quickest way to configure Strikes is to set the `DREADNODE_API_TOKEN` environment variable and
let the library handle the rest with `dreadnode.configure()`. However, there are quite a few additional
options you can set as needed.

## Using `configure()`

Initialize and set up connections with `configure()`.

```python
dreadnode.configure(
    server="https://platform.dreadnode.io",  # Platform URL
    token="your-api-token",                  # API token for authentication
    local_dir="./runs",                      # Directory for local span storage
    project="my-project",                    # Default project name
    console=True,                            # Enable console logging

    # OpenTelemetry options
    service_name="my-service",               # service name
    service_version="1.0.0",                 # service version
    otel_scope="dreadnode"                   # scope
)
```

## Using Environment Variables

Set variables to call `.config()` more easily.

```bash
export DREADNODE_SERVER_URL="https://platform.dreadnode.io"
export DREADNODE_API_TOKEN="your-api-token"
export DREADNODE_LOCAL_DIR="./runs"
export DREADNODE_PROJECT="my-project"
```
