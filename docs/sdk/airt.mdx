Attack
------

A declarative configuration for executing an attack.

This class composes all the necessary components (target, search strategy, objective)
and internally manages the creation and execution of an optimization Study.

### concurrency

```python
concurrency: int = Config(default=1, ge=1)
```

The maximum number of trials to evaluate in parallel.

### constraints

```python
constraints: list[Scorer[In]] | None = Config(default=None)
```

A list of Scorer constraints to apply to input attempts. If any constraint scores to a falsy value, the attempt is pruned.

### description

```python
description: str = Config(default='')
```

A brief description of the attack's purpose.

### direction

```python
direction: Direction = Config(default='maximize')
```

The direction of optimization for the objective score.

### max\_steps

```python
max_steps: int = Config(default=100, ge=1)
```

The maximum number of optimization steps to run.

### name

```python
name: str | None = Config(default=None)
```

The name of the attack - otherwise derived from the target.

### objective

```python
objective: Annotated[Scorer[Out], Config()]
```

The single scorer that defines the 'success' of a candidate.

### patience

```python
patience: int | None = Config(default=None, ge=1)
```

The number of steps to wait for an improvement before stopping. If None, this is disabled.

### search

```python
search: Annotated[Search[In], Config()]
```

The fully configured search strategy to generate attempts.

### tags

```python
tags: list[str] = Config(default_factory=lambda: ['attack'])
```

A list of tags associated with the attack.

### target

```python
target: Annotated[Target[In, Out], Config()]
```

The target to attack.

### target\_score

```python
target_score: float | None = Config(default=None)
```

A target score to achieve. The study will stop if a trial meets or exceeds this score.

prompt\_attack
--------------

```python
prompt_attack(goal: str, target: Target[str, str], attacker_model: str | Generator, evaluator_model: str | Generator, *, refine_guidance: str | None = None, evaluation_rubric: str | None = None, initial_prompt: str | None = None, beam_width: int = 3, branching_factor: int = 3, max_steps: int = 10, additional_scorers: list[Scorer] | None = None, name: str | None = None) -> Attack[str, str]
```

Creates a generalized generative attack using an attacker to refine prompts
and an evaluator to score the target's responses against a goal.

**Parameters:**

* **`goal`**
  (`str`)
  –The high-level objective of the attack.
* **`target`**
  (`Target[str, str]`)
  –The target system to be attacked.
* **`attacker_model`**
  (`str | Generator`)
  –The language model used to generate and refine prompts.
* **`evaluator_model`**
  (`str | Generator`)
  –The language model used to score the effectiveness of responses.
* **`refine_guidance`**
  (`str | None`, default:
  `None`
  )
  –Specific guidance for the attacker model on how to refine prompts.
  If None, a default guidance based on the goal is used.
* **`evaluation_rubric`**
  (`str | None`, default:
  `None`
  )
  –The rubric for the evaluator model to score responses.
  If None, a default rubric based on the goal is used.
* **`initial_prompt`**
  (`str | None`, default:
  `None`
  )
  –The starting prompt for the search. If None, the goal is used.
* **`beam_width`**
  (`int`, default:
  `3`
  )
  –The number of candidate prompts to maintain at each step of the search.
* **`branching_factor`**
  (`int`, default:
  `3`
  )
  –The number of new candidates to generate from each existing candidate.
* **`max_steps`**
  (`int`, default:
  `10`
  )
  –The maximum number of steps for the attack.
* **`additional_scorers`**
  (`list[Scorer] | None`, default:
  `None`
  )
  –A list of additional scorers to be combined with the primary
  LLM-based scorer.
