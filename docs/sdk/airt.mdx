```python
simba_search(
    original: Image,
    *,
    theta: float = 0.1,
    num_masks: int = 500,
    objective: str | None = None,
    distance_method: DistanceMethod = "l2",
    seed: int | None = None,
) -> Search[Image]
```

Implements the SimBA (Simple Black-box Attack) algorithm for generating
adversarial examples in a black-box setting.

This method iteratively perturbs the original image using random noise
masks and retains perturbations that improve the adversarial objective.

**Parameters:**

* **`original`**
  (`Image`)
  –The original, non-adversarial image.
* **`theta`**
  (`float`, default:
  `0.1`
  )
  –The magnitude of each perturbation step.
* **`num_masks`**
  (`int`, default:
  `500`
  )
  –The number of random noise masks to generate and use.
* **`objective`**
  (`str | None`, default:
  `None`
  )
  –The name of the objective to use for scoring candidates.
* **`distance_method`**
  (`DistanceMethod`, default:
  `'l2'`
  )
  –The distance metric to use for generating noise masks.
* **`seed`**
  (`int | None`, default:
  `None`
  )
  –Optional random seed for reproducibility.

**Returns:**

* `Search[Image]`
  –A Search that yields Trials with perturbed images.
