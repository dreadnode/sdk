  image is successfully adversarial. Used for early stopping.

Creates a SimBA (Simple Black-box Attack) for black-box image classifier settings.

A series of random perturbations masks are created, and for every search
iteration, a random mask is applied to the image. If the perturbation
improves the adversarial objective, it is retained; otherwise, it is discarded.

See: SimBA - https://arxiv.org/abs/1805.12317

* **`is_adversarial`**

  –An optional scorer that returns a positive value if the
  image is successfully adversarial. Used for early stopping.

  (`Norm`, default:
  `'l2'`
  )
  –The distance metric to use. Options are 'l2' (Euclidean
  distance), 'l1' (Manhattan distance), or 'linf' (Chebyshev distance).

Implements a Natural Evolution Strategies (NES) based search for black-box attacks.

This method estimates the full, dense gradient of the objective function by
querying the model along multiple random, high-dimensional directions. It offers an
excellent balance of query efficiency and gradient accuracy, making it a powerful
technique for black-box optimization.

**Parameters:**

* **`original`**
  (`Image`)
  –The original, non-adversarial image.
* **`objective`**
  (`str | None`, default:
  `None`
  )
  –The name of the objective to use for scoring candidates.
* **`max_iterations`**
  (`int`, default:
  `100`
  )
  –The number of main optimization iterations to perform.
* **`learning_rate`**
  (`float`, default:
  `0.01`
  )
  –The step size for updating the image based on the
  estimated gradient.
* **`num_samples`**
  (`int`, default:
  `64`
  )
  –The number of random direction vectors to sample for each
  gradient estimate. Total queries per iteration will be
  (2 \* num\_samples) + 1.
* **`sigma`**
  (`float`, default:
  `0.001`
  )
  –The exploration variance (magnitude of the random perturbations).
* **`adam_beta1`**
  (`float`, default:
  `0.9`
  )
  –The beta1 parameter for the Adam optimizer.
* **`adam_beta2`**
  (`float`, default:
  `0.999`
  )
  –The beta2 parameter for the Adam optimizer.
* **`adam_epsilon`**
  (`float`, default:
  `1e-08`
  )
  –The epsilon parameter for the Adam optimizer.
* **`seed`**
  (`int | None`, default:
  `None`
  )
  –Optional random seed for reproducibility.

**Returns:**

* `Search[Image]`
  –A Search that yields Trials with perturbed images.

Implements the SimBA (Simple Black-box Attack) algorithm for generating
adversarial examples in a black-box setting.

This method iteratively perturbs the original image using random noise
masks and retains perturbations that improve the adversarial objective.

**Parameters:**

  (`Image`)
  –The original, non-adversarial image.
* **`theta`**
  (`float`, default:
  `0.1`
  )
  –The magnitude of each perturbation step.
* **`num_masks`**
  (`int`, default:
  `500`
  )
  –The number of random noise masks to generate and use.
* **`objective`**
  (`str | None`, default:
  `None`
  )
  –The name of the objective to use for scoring candidates.
* **`norm`**
  (`Norm`, default:
  `'l2'`
  )
  –The distance metric to use for generating noise masks.
* **`max_iterations`**
  (`int`, default:
  `10000`
  )
  –The maximum number of iterations to perform.
* **`seed`**
  (`int | None`, default:
  `None`
  )
  –Optional random seed for reproducibility.

**Returns:**

* `Search[Image]`
  –A Search that yields Trials with perturbed images.
