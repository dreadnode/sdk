# Module `storage`

*(Full name: `dreadnode.artifact.storage`)*

**Source file:** `storage.py`

Artifact storage implementation for fsspec-compatible file systems.

Provides efficient uploading of files and directories with deduplication.

## Classes


### Class `ArtifactStorage`

**Inherits from:** `object`

Storage for artifacts with efficient handling of large files and directories.

Supports:
- Content-based deduplication using SHA1 hashing
- Batch uploads for directories handled by fsspec

#### Methods

##### `__init__`

`__init__(...)`

Initialize artifact storage with a file system and prefix path.

**Parameters:**

- **`file_system`**: FSSpec-compatible file system

---

##### `batch_upload_files`

`batch_upload_files(...)`

Upload multiple files in a single batch operation.

**Parameters:**

- **`source_paths`**: List of local file paths
- **`target_paths`**: List of target keys/paths

**Returns:** List of URIs for the uploaded files

---

##### `compute_file_hash`

`compute_file_hash(...)`

Compute SHA1 hash of a file, using streaming only for larger files.

**Parameters:**

- **`file_path`**: Path to the file
- **`stream_threshold_mb`**: Size threshold in MB for streaming vs. loading whole file

**Returns:** First 16 chars of SHA1 hash

---

##### `compute_file_hashes`

`compute_file_hashes(...)`

Compute SHA1 hashes for multiple files.

**Parameters:**

- **`file_paths`**: List of file paths to hash

**Returns:** Dictionary mapping file paths to their hash values

---

##### `store_file`

`store_file(...)`

Store a file in the storage system, using multipart upload for large files.

**Parameters:**

- **`file_path`**: Path to the local file
- **`target_key`**: Key/path where the file should be stored

**Returns:** Full URI with protocol to the stored file
