# Module `constants`

*(Full name: `dreadnode.tracing.constants`)*

**Source file:** `constants.py`

This module defines constants used for tracing spans and events in the Dreadnode SDK.

The constants include span attributes, event names, and event attributes, all of which
are namespaced under the `dreadnode` prefix. These constants are used to standardize
the structure and metadata of spans and events for tracing purposes.
