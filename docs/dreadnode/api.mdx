# Module `api`

*(Full name: `dreadnode.api`)*

**Source file:** `__init__.py`

This module initializes the `dreadnode.api` package.

The `dreadnode.api` package provides the API layer for interacting with the
Dreadnode SDK. It includes modules and functions for handling requests,
responses, and other API-related functionality.

Modules in this package should be imported and used to facilitate communication
with external services or internal components of the Dreadnode system.
