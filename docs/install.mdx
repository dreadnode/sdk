The `dreadnode` package is the python SDK that backs Strikes functionality. You'll use it to configure your experiments, track data, and send it to the Dreadnode Platform.

<Warning>
In order to use this package with the Dreadnode Platform, you will need [access to Strikes](https://platform.dreadnode.io/waitlist/strikes) and an [API key](https://platform.dreadnode.io/account).
While this isn't required for local development, it is necessary to use the Dreadnode Platform.
</Warning>

Installation may depend on your python package management, but we've included some common examples:

<CodeGroup>
```bash pip
pip install -U dreadnode
```

```bash uv
uv pip install dreadnode
```

```bash uv (project)
uv add dreadnode
```

```bash poetry (project)
poetry self add dreadnode
```
</CodeGroup>
