The `dreadnode` package is the python SDK that backs Strikes functionality. You'll use it to configure your experiments, track data, and send it to the Dreadnode Platform.

Installation may depend on your python package management, but we've included some common examples:

<CodeGroup>
```bash pip
pip install -U dreadnode
```

```bash uv
uv pip install dreadnode
```

```bash uv (project)
uv add dreadnode
```

```bash poetry (project)
poetry self add dreadnode
```
</CodeGroup>

<Warning>
In order to use this package with the public Dreadnode Platform, you will need [access to Strikes](https://platform.dreadnode.io/waitlist/strikes) and an [API key](https://platform.dreadnode.io/account).
While this isn't required for local development, it is necessary to use the Dreadnode Platform.

If you're using a **self-hosted platform**, you'll need to:
1. Obtain an API key from your self-hosted instance
2. Configure the SDK to point to your server URL (see [Configuration](/usage/config))
3. Ensure your self-hosted instance is accessible from your development environment
